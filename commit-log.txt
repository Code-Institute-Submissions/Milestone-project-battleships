2ebeae - 08/06/20 08:54 - "Added extra conditionals to intelligenceGuess so that it will not make a guess of a square already attempted."

a7cbe6 - 07/06/20 13:36 - "Removed functions 'hitStatus' and 'missStatus' to streamline 'userMakeGuess' and 'oppMakeGuess'"
be574a - 07/06/20 12:44 - "Renamed directory in functions.js so that links are now unbroken"
dfd0d0 - 06/06/20 16:38 - "Completed all styling and responsiveness for all elements across all screen widths."
fbb0dd - 06/06/20 14:01 - "Fixed previous 'scores-btn:hover' problem. Corrected any responsiveness errors for modal windows. Created 'endgame-modal' in index.html. This will open after the game ends, and prompts the user for a nickname to save their score. Once a name is submitted, 'saveScores' function will save the turncount and nickname in localstorage. This will be retrieved when 'scores-modal' is opened and display the top 10(if less, will display all saved scores) scores. Finally, debugged some minor errors with variables not being read for 'intelligenceGuess' function."
8122de - 06/06/20 09:27 - "Added responsiveness to all major elements. Minor problem with 'scores-btn':hover that needs to be fixed"
953e7a - 05/06/20 10:53 - "All major styling done. Created modal windows that are linked with javascript functions to open and close, using CSS animation, and update the user with messages. Created functions relating to the localstorage of scores that will be loaded with the opening of the scores modal."
62c014 - 02/06/20 23:07 - "Created new feature in 'showCoordinates' and 'placeShip', after placing a ship, there will only be one highlighted square, instead of 'shipLength'. This will also take effect while 'playGame' is running. Secondly, allowed ships to be redeployed during 'placementPhase == true'. Thirdly, debugged some faults in 'intelligenceGuess'."
7406df - 02/06/20 20:50 - "Created function intelligentGuess. This is an attempt to allow the opponent to make more accurate guesses in their next turn, based on the success of their previous guesses."
d9b412 - 01/06/20 21:39 - "Created 'turnCount' and 'userTurn = true/false', two variables that will recorded the number of turns that game has progressed through, and whose turn it is. The opponent will not make a guess until the user makes a guess first."
7cf89f - 01/06/20 21:10 - "Created 'getRandomCoordinate()' to randomly generate the coordinates of a square, and then submits that coordinate as the opponent's guess."
07b90a - 01/06/20 17:39 - "Created functions 'userHit' and 'userMiss'. This is part of a parent function 'userMakeGuess' that allows the user to click on the opponents game-board and will elict a response depending on if the square was occupied."
8191b9 - 01/06/20 16:06 - "Redefined eventHandlers of 'findCoordinates' 'showCoordinates' & 'unshowCoordinates'. This will allow the user highlight a square when the mouse enters the game board. Redefined some variables, and added 'whichBoard' so that the square is not highlighted across both boards. Additionally, created variable 'placementPhase' so that 'checkOccupiedStatus' will work in both the playing phase and placement phase of the game."
86469b - 01/06/20 11:29 - "Added 'showCoordinates' function. When a game square is hovered over (using the mouseenter event), the function will calculate the length of selected ship, and will project the position of that ship if it is placed. This will allow users to more strategically place their ships during the deployment phase of the game."
26b84c - 31/05/20 21:22 - "Reconfigured function 'checkReadyStaus', making it more succinct, while still returning a true or false statement. It will notify the user if they are trying to begin a game without placing all their ships."
418586 - 31/05/20 12:26 - "Created function 'checkOverlapStatus' that prohibits user from placing ships overlapping, whether this is crossing or stacking. Add comments to functions.js to follow the chain of events more succiently, and reorganised the '.ready()' fucntion to allow page to load more efficiently."
4b2dc0 - 30/05/20 21:14 - "Created 'Orientation Button' in index.html, and accompanying functions 'checkOrientation' & 'changeOrientation' that allows user to place ships vertically or horizontally."
505102 - 30/05/20 17:12 - "Created function 'calculateShipCoor'. When a user places a ship, it will calculate the required number of squares to place that ship, and then occupy the spaces."
5b4c8a - 30/05/20 15:25 - "Condensed/streamlined all 'place*' functions into one singular function 'placeShip'. Additionally created 'selectShip' that retrieves details of the ship that was clicked from array 'shipList'. Created 'findinMDArray' to supplement 'selectShip' to find index of specific ships in array 'shipList'."
f3aedc - 30/05/20 12:19 - "Created function 'findCoordinate' and 'checkOccupiedStatus'. If user clicks on a game square, function will retrieve the x&y coordinates of square, and check if it is occupied or not. It will return a true or false."
fb3135 - 29/05/20 17:08 - "Created 'getOpponentCoordinates' and 'checkReadyStatus' functions. This will upload a set of coordinates for the opponent, and see if the user has successfully placed all of their ships"
3a5ac0 - 29/05/20 01:19 - "In 'functions.js', prohibited user placing duplicate ships"
b2954f - 28/05/20 22:35 - "Troubleshooted 'placeShip' function. Now allows users to place all boats. Still allows duplicates. Next challenge"
886c9a - 28/05/20 14:53 - "Created onclick function 'placeShips' to allow users to place their pieces"
